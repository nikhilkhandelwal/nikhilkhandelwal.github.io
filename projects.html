<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>The following lists most of the projects, academic or otherwise, that I've worked on.  </p>

 <!--Machine Learning projects--> 

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<div class="archive_post"> <img src="./Handwriting_Recognition.png" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Handwritten Digits Classification<a href="#"></a></h4>
  <p>Classifying handwritten digits by implementing four machine learning techniques a) Neural Networks, b) K- Nearest
Neighbors, c)Logistic Regression, d) Support Vector Machines and compare their performance.: </p>

<ul style="margin-left:100px">
  <li>Classified the data set using Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network
  </li>
  <li>Classified the same data set using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) , Logistic Regression and SVN approach </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="archive_post"> <img src="diabetes.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Predicting Diabetes Level in patients<a href="#"></a></h4>
  <p>Predicting diabetes level in patients using four machine learning techniques a) Liner Regression, b) Ridge Regression c)
Ridge Regression using Gradient descent, d)Non-Linear Regression and compare their performance. </p>

<ul style="margin-left:100px">
  <li>Using the results obtained to make recommendations for anyone using regression for predicting diabetes level </li>
</ul>
</div>

  <!--Distributed systems projects--> 
  <h2>Distributed Systems</h2>
  
<div class="archive_post"><img src="dynamo.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Simplified Amazon Dynamo (Replicated Key-Value Storage)</h4>
  <p>Implemented a Amazon Dynamo-style key-value storage. The three main functionality implemented were 1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling in a Distributed system
The main goal is to provide both availability and linearizability at the same time.</p>

<ul style="margin-left:97px">
<li>Implemented Quorum replication with replication degree 3 and versioned all objects to differentiate between stale copies.</li>
  <li>  Handled node failures and ensured that when any node recovers/rejoins it should be updated with most recent copies</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="archive_post"><img src="dht.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Distributed Hash Table</h4>
  <p>Designed a simple DHT based on Chord protocol on android devices. There were upto 5 android devices that could participate to form a distributed network to store key-values pairs.
  </p>

<ul style="margin-left:97px">
<li>There are three main things that the protocol handled: 1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning when new node joined, 2) Ring-based routing system to store/retrieve messages in the correct node, and 3) Handle new node joins(upto5 nodes)</li>
  <li> The content provider on android devices supported insert and query operations. Thus, if multiple devices in a network ran the app, all content provider instances formed a Chord ring and serve insert/query requests in a distributed fashion according to the Chord protocol.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="archive_post"><img src="messenger.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Totally and Causally Ordered Group Messenger</h4>
  <p>Designed and implemented a Group messenger application for Android devices using Multi threading and Java Networking that preserves total ordering as well as causal ordering of all messages.
 </p>


<ul style="margin-left:97px">
<li>Content providers were used to maintain  key-value table that each device uses to individually store all messages on its local storage.</li>
  <li>  Implemented vector clock at each process to maintained happened before relationship within messages.</li>
  <li>Implemented a centralized sequencer to assign totally ordered identifiers to multicast messages so that each process makes the same ordering decision based upon these identifiers.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Big Data Projects--> 

<h2>Big Data</h2>
<div class="archive_post"><img src="hadoop.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Twiiter data analysis using Hadoop MapReduce</h4>
  <p>We aggregated interesting data from Twitter for different ranges of dates (week-range, month-range).Aggregated raw data was cleansed to some extend before analyzing it using R and Hadoop MapReduces.</p>

<ul style="margin-left:97px">

<li>Designed and implemented the MR work flows to extract various information from the real time data of Twitter (approx
1GB). For instance: simple word count, # tag counts, @ counts etc.</li>
<li> For popular hash tags, a connected network of tweeter-follower was created. Then we implemented the parallel breadth first search algorithm using Hadoop MapReduce to find the shortest path between users in the network</li>
<li>We clustered the tweeters by the number of followers they have,into three groups, low, medium and high respectively. This clustering was performed using Kmeans Clustering algorithm, implemented using hadoop MapReduce.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Big Data Projects end--> 


<!-- Information Retrieval--> 

<h2>Information Retrieval</h2>
<div class="archive_post"><img src="nlp.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Natural Language Processing based Question Answering System</h4>
  <p>Generated a back end from the Wikipedia corpus using Apache Solr and implemented a front end using J2EE technologies.The system could take in free text
  queries in English and generate a context aware answer to the query. The system was immune to simple spelling mistakes and also suggested 
  similar topics to search about.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:97px">

<li>Generated a back end from the Wikipedia corpus using Apache Solr and implemented a front end using J2EE technologies.</li>
<li>Advanced features like spell check and auto complete were also implemented using AJAX and JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="archive_post"><img src="wikipedia.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Wikipedia Inexer</h4>
<p> We took the big Wikipedia dump(10 GB) and processed it using Java. The courpus was clened , parsede and indexed, we also exposed an interface using which a user could 
query the system and read data in different forms.  
</p>

<ul style="margin-left:97px">

<li>SAX parser was used to parse the wikipedia corpus which is in XMl format </li>
<li> After baisc cleaning, we tokenzed the text using regular expressions. The tokenized data was then indexed and persisted in DB along with the word count for the whole corpus.  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Big Data Projects end--> 

 <h2>Side Projects</h2>
 
 <div class="archive_post"><img src="iremember.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>iRemember - An app for telling your stories</h4>
<p> iRemember is an android app that captures the stories of your life, connects them to the places where they happened, and lets
others see locations in a new way -- through your eyes.
With iRemember, users capture their stories in a variety of media: text, audio, photos or video. After
capturing the story, the app allows users to give it a title and to annotate it with text tags and location
information.
</p>



<div class="archive_post"><img src="twitterandroid.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>Twitter Client for Android</h4>
<p> The app could update the twitter status and also had a timeline to show recent activity on the twitter news feed.
The app was made to self learn the android framework and used all main building blocks like, Activity, Services, Content Provider, Preferences.
I used the twitter4j java api to login to twitter via OAuth and other functions like, acessing timeline and postin status.
</p>
</div>
 
 <div class="archive_post"><img src="stackoverflow.jpg" alt="" title="" border="" class="post_thumb" />
  <h4>A Stackover Flow style Q&A blog website using Ruby on Rails</h4>
  <p>
  The app will consist of users and their associated question (thus constituting a minimalist StackOverFlow style app).The app will have users, question, ability for other user to answer these questions,
  and a full login and authentication framework. The appliction will also provide every user to upvote answers, whcih will in turn give the OP a karma point. Also no user with karma less than 10 will be able to vote.
