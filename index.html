<p><strong>Accenture Services , Bangalore, India <br />
Software Engineer, July 2011 - July 2013 </strong> <br />Trained as a developer in Core Java and J2EE technologies, and TIBCO Active Matrix. Worked on a project which maintains the 

complete CRM application for a telecom company. I developed software for the business layer using TIBCO BW tool suite.</p>

<div class="inside_h2">Projects</div>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Middleware module for Mobile Number Portability (MNP)</strong></p>
  <p> Developed the system to synchronously complete a MNP request at multiple end systems with a 100% accuracy.
  Part of my responsibility was to  develop the module
   which handles the request within the middle ware. I also helped design the HTTP request protocols of an outgoing or incoming MNP requests.  </p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Streamline error handling of the current CRM application for a telecom company </strong></p>
  <p> Every day the CRM processed over a hundred thousand requests, out of which thousands of HTTP requests (per day) would time out in the CRM due to bottle neck in the billing systems. Developed a

flow for such request, to get stored in a buffer, before being automatically submitted when the end systems were available. This work was previous done manually and hence my tool was a very 
efficient solution. </p></li>
